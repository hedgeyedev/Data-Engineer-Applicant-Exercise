Written in Perl, on a Windows desktop running Strawberry Perl 5.26.0.1 64bit
CPAN Modules needed:
	LWP::Simple
	File::Path
To run, execute the grabber.pl script
additionally, this script does generate directories in which to store the first
image downloaded from each of the articles so gathered

tester.pl and debug.txt are files I use to test the csv output by grabber.pl

I wrote that script to ensure that the entirety of the ContentBodyHTML is on
one line with no newlines or commas. github and excel often interpret html tags
by adding newlines between them. such a format is not database-friendly so I made
sure that the raw csv was database-friendly, assuming the only delimiter is ',';
to run tester.pl, make sure it is in the same directory as collected.csv and execute it
