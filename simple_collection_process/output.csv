The U.S. economy is accelerating. Consider the facts. Year-over-year GDP growth peaked at 3.3% in the first quarter 2015, fell to 1.3% by the second quarter of 2016, and has since rebounded to 2% for the first quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>We expect rebounding U.S. growth to continually surprise Wall Street consensus throughout 2017.</p>  <p><a href="https://d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/48206/large/gdp_yoy.png" rel="popover"><img alt="Why Wall Street Is (Really) Wrong on the U.S. Economy - gdp yoy" class="img-responsive" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 75vw" src="//d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/48206/normal/gdp_yoy.png" srcset="//d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/48206/lead/gdp_yoy.png 330w, //d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/48206/medium/gdp_yoy.png 390w, //d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/48206/normal/gdp_yoy.png 600w, //d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/48206/large/gdp_yoy.png 900w"></a></p> <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><b>IT'S WORTH NOTING...</b><b> </b></span></h3> <p><span style="color: #000000;">To close the month of May, the S&amp;P 500 sectors reflect a growing U.S. economy.
