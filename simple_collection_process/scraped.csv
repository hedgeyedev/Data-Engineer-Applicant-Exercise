Yellen's Hubris: Is She Repeating Bernanke's Big Mistake?

<p><em>“Would I say there will never ever be another financial crisis, probably that would be going too far. But I do think that we are much safer and I hope that it will not be our lifetime and I don’t believe it will be.”</em><br>–<em><strong>Fed Chair Janet Yellen June 27, 2017</strong></em></p>
<p>There are just some things that should never be said, and then there are things that the head of a Central Bank should never say. Yellen’s hubristic comments are rooted in her confidence in the post-crisis reform, oversight and regulation. Her words exude the confidence of an academic Central Banker who believes markets and the economy can be micromanaged on a safe and steady path. The Fed Chair’s comment is alarming because investors and traders are well aware that we live in an uncertain world with infinite possibilities. In addition to the technical failure among Technology names, we suspect the ignorance of Yellen’s comment undermined investor confidence.</p>
<p>Chair Yellen’s assertion above today is eerily reminiscent of <strong>Chairman Bernanke</strong>’s <a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070517a.htm"" target=""_blank"">assertion</a> a decade ago:</p>
<table class=""full-article__paragraph--gray-box"">
<tr>
<td class=""full-article__paragraph-padding"">
<p>“All that said, given the fundamental factors in place that should support the demand for housing, we believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited, and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.” Ironically, this afternoon Chair Yellen also explained the environment preceding the global financial crisis. “Most advanced economies were pretty stable, macro performance was good. Inflation which has been very high in the seventies and brought down in the eighties was pretty low and stable. Central Bankers were patting themselves on the back, that they understood how to do their jobs and that they had developed frameworks that worked. I think many people thought- the business cycle we figured all of this out, it is fundamentally dead. Perhaps that was a problem also for individuals who thought –you know what, this isn’t a very risky environment perhaps that whole environment was one that encouraged undue risk taking especially with low interest rates- people searching for yield.”</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Is that not what <strong>Chair Yellen</strong> has done today, patting her own back highlighting the safety and soundness of the system? Honestly, if one did not know she was talking about 2007, you would think she was talking about 2017.</p>
<p>Financial stability, financial conditions and asset valuations appear to be high on the Fed’s list of concerns lately. In the past 48 hours, the three most influential Fed officials have weighed in on these topics. <strong>NY Fed President Dudley</strong> started the week noting that easy financial conditions are allowing the FOMC to continue to tighten amidst decelerating employment and inflation growth. Today, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair <strong>Stanley Fischer</strong> gave a speech on financial stability offering a more reasoned perspective:</p>
<table class=""full-article__paragraph--gray-box"">
<tr>
<td class=""full-article__paragraph-padding"">
<p>“However, it would be foolish to think we have eliminated all risks. For example, we still have limited insight into parts of the shadow banking system, and--as already mentioned--uncertainty remains about the final configuration of short-term funding markets in the wake of money funds reform.”</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A portion of Fischer's speech was devoted to asset valuations. The Vice Chair described the appetite for risk as “high” while noting that “Prices of risky assets have increased in most major asset markets in recent months even as risk-free rates also rose. In equity markets, price-to-earnings ratios now stand in the top quintiles of their historical distributions, while corporate bond spreads are near their post-crisis lows.”</p>
<p>Chair Yellen also weighed in on asset valuations today.</p>
<table class=""full-article__paragraph--gray-box"">
<tr>
<td class=""full-article__paragraph-padding"">
<p>“Asset valuations are somewhat rich if you use some traditional metrics like price earnings ratios, but I wouldn’t try to comment on appropriate valuations and those ratios…asset prices can move and we don’t target asset prices. We’re focused on employment and inflation. What is very important from our point of view is the soundness of the financial system… Asset prices can move they can cause losses to individuals who decided to invest in things that fall in price, but we’re worried about systemic risk and with a strong banking system those kind of repercussions are not at the top of my list.”</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It is not every day that the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve both weigh in on asset valuations describing them as “rich.” After a decade of Fed officials (including Yellen and Dudley) openly admitting that policy supported asset prices and was intended to push investors further out on the risk curve, the Chair is attempting to return to the forgotten mantra that policy is driven by developments in the economy.</p>
<p>This appears to be a coordinated effort when taken into consideration with President Dudley’s comments about financial conditions easing. What is most powerful here is that Yellen is redirecting the focus of the Fed Put away from asset values and placing it more narrowly on systemic risks. While we do not believe this Fed has the fortitude to truly step away from supporting asset prices, we do believe there is a great deal of risk associated with Chair Yellen’s overconfidence in the system and the environment she has created.</p>

<p>The U.S. economy is heating up. That's the latest news from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics today which revised year-over-year first quarter GDP up to 2.1% from an original estimate of 1.9%. </p>
<p>Now consider these headlines, a then and now look at the ""advance estimate"" of GDP from April and today's third revision:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>MarketWatch </strong>(6/29/17): Poor start to 2017? Not really. First quarter GDP raised again to 1.4%</li>
<li>
<strong>MarketWatch</strong> (4/28/17): U.S. economy bogs down in first quarter with slowest growth in 3 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to pick on MarketWatch, but headlines like this are pervasive across the mainstream media. Media outlets look at, what we see as, an arbitrary measure of GDP called the quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate. It's a clunky measure you'd never see on the financial statements of any publically-traded company and subject to massive revisions. The <strong>QoQ SAAR</strong> for the first quarter of 2017 was originally estimated at 0.7% revised to today's 1.4%.</p>
<p>Don't get whipped around by these wonky measures. Instead, we look at year-over-year growth which more accurately captures the trend in the <strong>U.S. economy</strong>. Here goes: In the first quarter of 2015, year-over-year GDP peaked at 3.3% fell to 1.3% by the second quarter of 2016 and has since rebounded to 2.1% in the first quarter of 2017.</p>

<p>Investors are getting a gift today. Stock market indices were down as much as 2% today, but the U.S. economy is accelerating.</p>
<p>We say buy the dip.</p>
<p>That’s been our mantra on every stock market pullback for the past seven months now. The <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> is up 7% in the last six months, and <strong>Nasdaq</strong> is up 14.4% since then.</p>
<p>There’s good reason for this. In the first quarter of 2015, year-over-year GDP peaked at 3.3%, fell to 1.3% by the second quarter of 2016, and has since rebounded to 2.1% in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>“This is what economic growth has done.

<p>“This is the main reason you’re making money being long growth stocks is because U.S. growth accelerated,” McCullough says. We expect the U.S. economy to continue to go up from here. “And before you know it you’re going to have close to 3% GDP growth, just as the IMF takes down their forecast,” McCullough says.</p>

<p><br>For many traders, it was a shock to see the barrel of oil collapse to 12-month lows in June, despite an agreement from producers to cut supplies. However, not many people are talking about the falling prices in other commodities, as well as the positive impact of low oil prices on global growth.</p>
<p>So why is a barrel of West Texas Intermediate still trading for below $50? The problem is not just due to oversupply, but also to a slowdown in the growth of Asian demand. Chinese demand has supported prices for the past decade, as demand in developed markets has reduced thanks to increases in efficiency, substitution, and technology.</p>
<p>However, China’s stockpiles have risen to 511 million barrels in capacity, just below the 693 million barrels the United States held in March. Chinese industrial demand is also falling, due to rebalancing away from the industrial sector and toward services.</p>
<p>But oil prices, in this context, are just a symptom of a much more severe illness: the excess debt and overcapacity created in China to support an unsustainable growth model.</p>
<p>In the first five months of 2017, China has added more debt than the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan combined. While GDP growth looks healthy as is, it appears weak and potentially dangerous when compared to the increase in the money supply. As the old economy tapers off, fewer and fewer raw materials will be needed for production.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #252729;""><strong>Dollar Flows</strong></span></h3>
<p>Low oil prices have knock-on effects on other emerging markets. Commodity producers like Mexico and Saudi Arabia are facing another “sudden stop”: the abrupt reduction in U.S. dollar inflows, as debt repayments in foreign currency escalate.</p>
<p>Most economic growth estimates for 2017 were made using much higher oil prices, and the market is likely to see downgrades in expectations of inflation and growth in the majority of the large emerging economies. We are already seeing significant downward revisions for Brazil, Argentina, Russia, and other economies.</p>
<p>According to ICBC Standard Bank, emerging market debt maturities through 2020 will exceed $1.4 trillion. At the same time, as rates rise in the United States, capital flows to emerging markets are much lower than those seen in the past decade. Low interest rates may mask these risks in the short term, as central banks are increasing the money supply by more than $200 billion per month, but they do not eliminate them.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #252729;""><strong>Not Just Oil</strong></span></h3>
<p>There is another factor beyond oil prices worrying investors. Copper prices, a major indicator of global economic activity, continue to be weak due to oversupply and lower Chinese demand.</p>
<p>Market expectations for revamped growth and higher inflation in 2017 and 2018 stand at odds with the decline in major commodities like copper and oil. More importantly, the decline might be a warning sign of a much deeper problem. The more than $20 trillion in monetary stimuli globally has delivered disappointing growth, as well as contagion risk as financial imbalances across countries rose.</p>
<p>Low oil and commodity prices benefit the users of such commodities like the United States and Western Europe. However, given their negative impact on weaker emerging economies, their price decline may be the canary in the coal mine for the world economy.</p>
