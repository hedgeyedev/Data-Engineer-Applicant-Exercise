What is the single biggest market risk right now?</b></p><p>Same as the past 3 decades  Central Banks and unstable FX management&hellip;but compounded  with the risks buried deeper and more thoroughly each bailout cycle.</p><p>Global Central Banks have removed (and paid up) for $10 trillion in risk assets from the markets since the GFC (more than the entire mined gold supply in human history)  and global net-issuance of government debt has been ~0$ for first time in world history for nearly two years now.</p><p>WE SHOULD PRINT THIS ON OUR ASSET STATEMENTS AND NEVER FORGET IT.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding that much liquidity was a tightrope walk we should give them credit for  they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;saved&rdquo; a capital markets-centric economy in the short term  but the risk is likely our political systems when they are forced to withdraw or add more. We are mispricing volatility (which is the key determinant of all markets) on such a massive scale  that the only remaining buffer in our global-cap structure  during an inevitable spike in volatility  is now our currency. ..But the risk is not the lofty valuation of assets and equites  but currency and the notion of reverting to &ldquo;risk free&rdquo; is now the ultimate trap.</p><p>An entire generation has been disincentivized to save  calibrated on bailout economics  lacing massive bias&rsquo; in all ETFs and algorithm products  and the vast majority of &ldquo;main street&rdquo; assumes this is part of a normal market cycle and a &ldquo;dollar is always a dollar&rdquo;. Moral hazard is embedded in market incentives to the point that the next guaranteed-recessionary bailout (from thinking this all &ldquo;worked&rdquo;) will likely break this half-century-old currency regime  and likely take many political systems with it.</p><p>So the risk is social. Assets and income has to converge  either through capital stock deflation  or wage inflation. Since their system is allowing neither  nature will find a way. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong of course  but the fact that we aren&rsquo;t allowed to even debate this economic view within an accepted band of opposition has elevated the risk of unpreparedness and lack of backup planning.</p><p><b>2. Where do you think the most attractive 1-2 opportunities exist for investors?</b></p><p>In general  stay &ldquo;short currency  long scarcity&rdquo;.&nbsp; Keep accumulating gold; follow Buffett&rsquo;s lead and own oligopolistic distribution networks with this gift liquidity; and good real estate (probably higher-end in &ldquo;second tier&rdquo; cities that didn&rsquo;t get the first wave reflation-bubble near financial  tech  energy  or revolving door-political cities). Don&rsquo;t be afraid of &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; if it has Ricardian rents or monopoly power  it will only get more expensive as the denominator falls in value. Measure with gold. &nbsp;</p><p><b>3. What investment would you avoid like the plague?</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Perpetually profitless assets &ndash; return free risk (Tesla and the &ldquo;tech 3.0&rdquo; wave that doesn&rsquo;t believe in profit; most cryptocurrencies &amp; ICOs  low &amp; negative yielding sovereign duration).&nbsp;</p><p><b>4. Are we on the road to a cashless society?</b></p><p>No. Some want to take us there  but they&rsquo;re on the wrong side of history. QE emboldened this crowd  but their NIRP + Cashless hubris will ultimately end them (governments will have to decide if they support it or not; if they do  regimes will end alongside that line of economic thinking). Investors should understand and position for this inevitable path. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>5. If you could travel back in time  where would you go?</b></p><p>1998 Russia (I wasn&rsquo;t there until 2002). &nbsp;Super interesting culturally  and good opportunity to pick up a few global assets classes at that time!&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>6. If you were an animal  what would you be?</b></p><p>Monkey</p><p><b>7.

What are you watching on TV?</b></p><p>I cut the cable two decades ago  don&rsquo;t really watch TV.&nbsp; But I Netflix binge now and then  currently <i>Better Call Saul</i> and <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>.</p><p><b>11. What&rsquo;s the most important book you&rsquo;ve ever read?</b></p><p>That&rsquo;s like picking your most important child! My core economic thinking is probably shaped by: The Prize  House of Morgan  Black Swan  Guns  Germs and Steel  and Adam Smith&rsquo;s Moral Sentiments.</p><p>I also love Victorian Internet  Five Equations that changed the world; G&ouml;del  Escher  Bach; Deep Simplicity  and everything I&rsquo;ve read by Ray Bradbury  Hunter S. Thompson  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  and Nikolai Gogol!</p><p><b>12. If you could tell your 14-year old self one thing  what would it be?</b></p><p>Spend more time learning music. ...also  really seek to understand trust and all of its complexities. At the core there is two kinds; intellect and intent. Neither is good enough without the other  and they overlap less than we&rsquo;d like. Maybe 4% of the population are high caliber in both &ndash; if natural power laws apply &ndash; seek out these people always.</p><p><b>13. What is the greatest invention of all time?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m still working on it ;)</p><p>&hellip;In the past  toss-up between the telegraph  Haber process in fertilizer synthetization  Patterson and Newton&rsquo;s Bank of England framework (and the worst being its corruption!)</p><p><b>14.

Yes  I&rsquo;m still driving my second one.</p><p><b>16. Are America&rsquo;s best days behind or ahead?</b></p><p>Depends on who you are.</p><p>Administrative middle class peaked well over a decade ago. 1% peaking now. Lower middle class and minorities will have much better days ahead after a tough past decade  but probably more short term pain in near future.</p><p>But overall  I&rsquo;m optimistic if we can clear the decks of this rigged political-economic system sooner rather than later. I&rsquo;m excited by our social progress and many technologies  depressed that our central planning systems only know how to get worse with time (what other product is so objectively worse three decades later than our currency?).</p><p><b>17. What&rsquo;s the best piece of advice you&rsquo;ve ever received?</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>During grad school: quit your engineering job  become a brewery-tour guide at Coors; learn how to communicate and explain things to anyone  and how to create happiness with information.</p><p><b>18. What&rsquo;s your favorite quote?</b></p><p><em>&ldquo;The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.&rdquo;</em><br />&ndash;Hunter S.

In his 1889 essay&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decay_of_Lying" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="5"><em>The Decay of Lying</em></a>  Wilde opined that  &ldquo;Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.&rdquo; Jackson Pollock  the American painter  aesthetically rejected both philosophies as facile. We are left to ponder the genius of his work  which in hindsight  leaves no doubt that Art intimidated Life.</p><p>Engulfed in the flames of depression and the demons it awakened  Pollock&rsquo;s work is often assumed to have peaked in 1950. The multihued vibrancy of his earlier abstract masterpieces descends into black and white  symbolically heralding his violent death in 1956 at the tender age of 44. Or does it? Look closer the next time you visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/83642" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="5">The Art Institute of Chicago</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jackson-pollock.org/greyed-rainbow.jsp" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="5"><strong>Greyed Rainbow</strong></a>  his mammoth 1953 tour de force  will at once arrest and hypnotize you. As you struggle to tear your eyes from it  you&rsquo;ll ask yourself what the critics could have been thinking  to have drawn such premature conclusions as to his peak. Such is the pained beauty of the work. Rather than feign containment  the paint looks as if it will burst the frames&rsquo; binding. And the color is there for the taking  if you have the patience to slow your minds&rsquo; eye and see what&rsquo;s staring back at you.</p><p>Perhaps it was the being written off aspect that drove Pollock to embark upon the final leg of his tour de force. We&rsquo;ll never know. Renaissances to sublimity are the preserve of those with gifts beyond most our grasps. Hence the curious hubris driving so many pensions to reinvent themselves to full solvency by taking on undue risks. Heedless of what should be so many warning signs  so many managers continue to herd blindly into unconventional terrain hoping to find that perfect portfolio mix. The more likely upshot is their choices will drive them straight off a rocky cliff.</p><h3><span style="color: #000000;">Inside The Country's Largest Pension Fund</span></h3><p>For now  the craggy landscape of pension canvases continue to be painted. Or in the case of the country&rsquo;s largest pension  the stage continues to be set. This from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/about/organization/executive-officers/ted-eliopoulos" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="5">Ted Eliopoulos  chief investment officer of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS)</a>:</p><table class="full-article__paragraph--gray-box"><tr><td class="full-article__paragraph-padding"><p><em>&ldquo;We will be conducting quite elaborate choreography  looking at asset allocation  our liabilities and the risk tolerance of our board in conjunction with our expected rates of return for our various candidate portfolios.&rdquo;</em></p></td></tr></table><p>Oh  but for the days of antiquated notions such as matching assets to liabilities. But that&rsquo;s so 80s. Today  a given public pension&rsquo;s portfolio is anything but dominated by the Treasury bonds once held to satisfy its future liabilities. Rather  half of a typical portfolio&rsquo;s assets are invested in stocks  a quarter in bonds and cash  and the balance in &lsquo;alternative investments &rsquo; including private equity  hedge funds  real estate and commodities. (Yes  we are still on the subject of matching current and future retiree paychecks to appropriate investments.)</p><p>To CalPERS credit  this &lsquo;elaborate&rsquo; mix turned in stellar performance in its most recent fiscal year ended June 30. The $323 billion fund generated a net 11.2 percent return buoyed by a 19.7 percent return on its stocks. Returns of 14 percent on its private equity holdings and 7.6 percent on real estate rounded out the outperformance.</p><p>Eliopoulos stressed that  &ldquo;as pleased as we are with this one-year return  our focus is always on the long-term. We invest for decades  not years.&rdquo;</p><p>As pointed out in Barron&rsquo;s  it&rsquo;s been touch and go for the past few decades. CalPERS returned 4.4 percent compared to the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 7.1 percent  and over the past 20 years  6.6 percent vs. the market&rsquo;s 7.1 percent. Neither achieved return  it should be pointed out  exceeds the fund&rsquo;s currently assumed rate of return of 7.5 percent or the assumed rate to which it will be lowered  seven percent  by the end of 2019.</p><p>The ultralow interest rate environment engineered by the Federal Reserve and unattained return goals leave CalPERS 68 percent funded. That puts it just about in line with Wilshire Consulting&rsquo;s most recent calculations  which found the average aggregate funding ratio for state pension plans to be 69 percent.</p><p>So very few pensions are where they need to be. And fewer still will ever get there. Pension managers are deluding themselves into believing creativity in asset allocation holds the key to greatness in the after-working-life.</p><h3><span style="color: #000000;">The Vagaries of Portfolio Construction: "Alternatives"</span></h3><p>Afraid to say the miracle of alternative investments cannot make up for the average four-percent differential required to make pensions whole &ndash; just this year. How so on the math? A blended portfolio of cash  investment-grade and junk bonds today earns 3.5-percent; this compares to pensions&rsquo; average assumed rate of return of 7.5 percent. Of course  this gap has been widening for years care of dim-witted central bankers who excel at calculus but can&rsquo;t manage simple math.</p><p>How unfair is it to leave out portfolios&rsquo; spice girls of equities and alternatives? Hate to turn down the party music  but starting points do matter. So do fees (hold that thought).</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing to say pensions won&rsquo;t eke out another exceptional year of stock gains. The Fed could well be tantalizing investors with chatter of QE4 if the economic data continue to soften. But there&rsquo;s no silver lining in that potential outcome. Remember that rocky cliff over which current reckless allocations can drive returns? Let&rsquo;s just say the cliff gets taller  and the fall longer  for every year into which this aged-bull-market rally stretches.</p><p>As for those alternatives  for better or for worse  commodities are pass&eacute;. Meanwhile  pensions have been abandoning hedge funds for years as passive investing takes victim active managers who dare value an asset and invest accordingly. And real estate is on fire. As in  valuations have never been this steep in the history of mankind. You can draw your own conclusions on that front.</p><p>That leaves us with private equity  that darling of asset classes and the issue of those pesky steep fees. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts  states bled $10 billion in fees and investment-related costs in 2014  the latest year for which data are available. Not only is this lovely line item funds&rsquo; largest expense; fees are up by about a third over the past decade  which conveniently coincides with the greater adoption of alternatives. Gotta love being a taxpayer!</p><p>But surely pensioners are privileged to have access to these tony private equity funds? Over the long haul  PE always outperforms those stodgy asset classes every Tom  Dick and Harry can buy online. So what if they&rsquo;re illiquid. Right?</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the shivers sent down the spines of many pension fund managers when they heard the news that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-oil-idUSKBN1A10UX" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="5">EnerVest Ltd</a>  a $2 billion PE fund  had lost all its value. &ldquo;Though private-equity investments regularly flop &rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported  &ldquo;industry consultants and fund investors say this situation could mark the first time that a fund larger than $1 billion has lost essentially all of its value.&rdquo;</p><p>Well at least the oil bust is long over. Ill-fated  ill-timed  ill-valued energy investments are to blame for EnerVest&rsquo;s demise. And surely that&rsquo;s a comfort. It positively proves the fund&rsquo;s evisceration is an isolated idiosyncratic incident.</p><p>Those other Wall Street Journal (WSJ) headlines don&rsquo;t mean a thing. Why worry that  &ldquo;Shale Produces Oil  So Why Doesn&rsquo;t It Produce Cash  Too?&rdquo; To wit  over the past decade  eight of the most established shale players have generated a respectable $414 billion in revenue but nary a penny in free cash flow. In fact  this eightsome has had negative cash flow of $68 billion.</p><p>Still think EnerVest will be a one-off event? Try this other WSJ headline from early July:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-cash-pumps-up-oil-production-even-as-prices-sag-1499419801" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="5">&ldquo;Wall Street Cash Pumps Up Oil Production Even As Prices Sag &rdquo;</a>&nbsp;an article that went on to cite one analyst&rsquo;s observation of  &ldquo;insufficient discrimination on the part of sources of capital.&rdquo;</p><p>Why  the question must be posed  bother discriminating when you&rsquo;re sitting on $1.5 trillion in dry powder? Wait  are we still talking about energy? Well  no. That&rsquo;s the point.</p><p>Go back to that last WSJ article for a moment  to what the reporters wrote: &ldquo;Wall Street has become an enabler that pushes companies to grow production at any cost  while punishing those that try to live within their means.&rdquo;</p><p>Set aside the fact that the analogy strikes closely to that of a drug dealer.&nbsp;Now nix the word  &lsquo;production&rsquo; and fill in the blank with whatever your heart desires. THAT is the power of $1.5 trillion in private equity dry powder in all the forms it has the capacity to assume.</p><h3><span style="color: #252729;">The Woes of State Pension Funds</span></h3><p>Again  starting points matter. That is  unless you are a deep-pocketed price agnostic buyer  one that collects fees for assets under management  regardless of how well the investment decisions fare. Being valuation-insensitive  however  also means you can incinerate your investors  especially pensions  and still walk away all the richer for it.</p><p>To its credit  Pew expressed particular concern with respect to desperate pensions playing the game of returns catch-up  as in those that have most recently plowed headlong into alternatives. No surprise  they happen to be one in the same with those sporting the weakest 10-year returns.</p><p>Ever heard someone tell you to not put all of your eggs in one basket? This rule of thumb applies in spades to pensions  or at least it should. While alternatives may provide a degree of diversification  Pew reports that that the use of alternatives among the nation&rsquo;s 73 largest state-sponsored pension funds ranges from zero to over 50 percent.</p><p>Arizona tops the far end of that range  with 56 percent of its assets in alternatives. Missouri and Pennsylvania are not far behind with over 50 percent in this &lsquo;basket &rsquo; and Illinois  Michigan  Ohio  South Carolina and Utah stand out as having close to 40 percent in alternatives.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2017/04/psrs_state_public_pension_funds_increase_use_of_complex_investments.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-slimstat="3">Click for link to PEWTrusts.org report</a>.</p><p>In the weeks to come  many pensions will excel in the back-slapping department  reporting double-digit returns for the fiscal year ended June 30th. Please keep your salt shaker handy.</p><p>For the third time  starting points matter. In late June  Moody&rsquo;s ran some figures and scenarios to quantify where pensions are today  and where they&rsquo;re headed. In 2016  total net pension liabilities (NPLs) surpassed $4 trillion. Looking ahead  Moody&rsquo;s expects reported NPLs to fall one percent by 2019 in an upside scenario  but&nbsp;<strong><em>rise</em></strong>&nbsp;59 percent in a downside scenario.</p><p>Perhaps the fine folks at Moody&rsquo;s have contemplated what happens when  not if  pensions&rsquo; liquid equity and bond holdings lose 20 percent. Maybe they&rsquo;ve even taken their scenarios one step further and envisioned the return implications for all of these elegant alternatives when a liquidity freeze takes hold amid plummeting valuations.</p><p>What&rsquo;s a pension to do? Fraught managers are apt to throw more of your money at alternatives as tax revenues rise to compensate for what pensions cannot make up in returns. Know this: the more that $1.5-trillion store of dry powder grows  the more it devolves into that much napalm in the morning. The conflagration that spreads will not be containable  and you won&rsquo;t be able to tear your eyes from it. As the tragic Pollock said of his paintings  and we will one day say of pensions  they have no beginnings or endings  they have lives of their own.</p><h3><span style="color: #339ef3;">EDITOR'S NOTE</span></h3><p>This is a<em>&nbsp;Hedgeye Guest Contributor</em>&nbsp;piece&nbsp;written by Danielle DiMartino Booth.

What is the single biggest market risk right now?</strong></p><p>The single biggest risk to the markets in my view is the structural risk presented by the insanely aggressive positioning of participants. This is not just the popularity of short vol trades  it&rsquo;s the other selling of insurance trades like short puts and the selling of credit default swaps and literally catastrophe insurance.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also all of the leveraged volatility targeting layered on top of that stuff. Risk parity is probably the most famous of these but it&rsquo;s just one part.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Where do you think the most attractive opportunity exists for investors?</strong></p><p>Cash now has a positive yield for the first time in the better part of decade. For the average investor  this should be far more attractive than the alternatives which very likely offer negative rates of return over the next several years.</p><p>But what makes cash most valuable today is its optionality. It gives you the chance to take advantage of opportunities that will most assuredly arise.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. What stock would you avoid like the plague?</strong></p><p>Nvidia (NVDA).</p><p>There is so much hype in the share price today that it almost guarantees a bad outcome for buyers at current prices. Full disclosure: I&rsquo;m short the semiconductor ETF.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. If you could travel back in time  where would you go?</strong></p><p>I would go back to the 1929 bubble just to witness two things.</p><p>First  just to see first hand how similar it was to the bubbles we have been through over the past 20 years. And second  to look over Jesse Livermore&rsquo;s shoulder as he traded the crash.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. If you were an animal  what would you be?</strong></p><p>I would be an osprey. I&rsquo;m a very solitary person literally and figuratively and I look at the markets like an osprey watches a river.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Starbucks or Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts?</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.dutchbros.com/">Dutch Bros </a>(it&rsquo;s an Oregon thing).</p><p></p><p><strong>7. If you could listen to only one album for the rest of your life what would it be?</strong></p><p>Solitude on Guitar  Baden Powell de Aquino</p><p></p><p><strong>8. What really annoys you?</strong></p><p>How popular logical fallacies have become in our daily discourse.</p><p></p><p><strong>9. What is your favorite movie of all time?</strong></p><p>Can&rsquo;t pick just one.

Guess What? Costco Is Beating Amazons Prices,2017-07-24,16:31:43,-04:00,n/a,n/a,n/a,<p><div class="video-container-wrapper">  <div class="video-container">    <iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" height="540" width="960" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GgBwVp2B72w?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;controls=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>    </iframe>  </div></div></p><p>This next fact might shock you: In 2016  Amazon accounted for more than 40% of U.S. online retail sales. To be sure  <strong>Amazon</strong> (AMZN) is changing the game for retailers around the world  but isnt taking over all of retail.</p><p>Just ask <strong>Costco</strong> (COST).</p><p>In the video excerpt above  from a recent institutional call on <em>Best Idea</em> Long Costco  Hedgeye Consumer Staples analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/HedgeyeFood" target="_blank"><strong>Shayne Laidlaw</strong></a> explains why the $65 billion discount retailer is actually beating Amazon on price.</p><p>In a Hedgeye survey of 2 269 individuals  about 25% of respondents (523 for this particular question) had both an Amazon Prime subscription and a Costco membership. Of that 25%  about 63% said their primary reason for shopping at Costco was the price to value  selected over options such as the experience  convenience and product selection.</p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE</strong>: Amazon is absolutely disrupting the world of retail. But Costco is still thriving in spite of all the hype.</p></div><div class='author-tag'><h3><a class="cta-signup" href="https://accounts.hedgeye.com/products">Subscribe</a>to<span itemprop='author' itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/Organization'><a class='author-link' href='https://plus.google.com/+hedgeye/' itemprop='url' target='_blank'><span itemprop='name'>HEDGEYE.</span></a></span></h3>
