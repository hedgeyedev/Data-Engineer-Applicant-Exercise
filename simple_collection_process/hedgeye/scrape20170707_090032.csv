0,06/23/17 08:48 AM EDT,CHA-CHING! Get Long Las Vegas... Buy This Stock,,,,"The U.S. economy is heating up, and so are Las Vegas slot machines.
Think about it.
“One of the most obvious ways to get long consumer discretionary spending is to get long Las Vegas,” says Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough. And if you want a pure play on Vegas, the stock to buy is Red Rocks Resorts (RRR), McCullough says in the video above from The Macro Show.
It’s a stock our Gaming, Lodging and Leisure analyst Todd Jordan likes.
""We are starting to see what appears to be somewhat of a locals renaissance, which bodes well for Red Rocks Resorts (RRR) which derives most of its EBITDA in the LV locals market,” Jordan wrote recently.
""Add in a potential value creating real estate transaction, and this 2018 and beyond story is quite compelling.”
A compelling opportunity indeed.

1,06/23/17 11:25 AM EDT,"McCullough: We're Bullish on Tech, Bearish on Energy",,,,"Editor's Note: Below is a transcribed excerpt from Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough's recent interview on Macro Voices hosted by hedge fund manager Erik Townsend.
In the excerpt below, Keith describes why the Tech rally is not over and why we're bearish on Energy stocks. Click here for a very special deal we offered to all listeners. To listen to the entire conversation, click the podcast player below or visit the Macro Voices website.
Erik: Let's come back to your reflation rolling over theme, the slide deck that you sent us, we've got several slides on that, our registered users can find the download link in the research roundup email. If you're not registered yet we told you earlier in the program how to get the slide deck.
Walk us through this, what you see in the reflection trick as well, I find particularly interesting is most of the people now that are all telling the same story because it's popular about the reflation trade rolling over, they're also turning into big equity bears and you've got the reflation trade rolling over theme but you're actually equity bullish.
So, how does this all tie together?
Keith: Well I think if you just separate this down to two columns and you have your longs and your shorts, I mean if you want to be short reflation, the other side of that ledger is being long what we call real growth.
So, real growth accelerates, I'm pretty sure that most people that do macro should understand this, if they don't, it's a very simple calculus. When inflation slows at the rate of change basis the deflator (i.e. how you calculate GDP) falls. So, the deflator falls and real GDP rises. It's not that complicated.
I do agree that a lot of people have been bearish on the stock market for the last three, four, five, six, seven months and they just kind of wander out there like a macro tourists to the next thing that is bearish. Now there's always going to be something that's bearish, my goal is to find it.
But it doesn't always have to be where you're hoping it is. Most people start with, “Wow, that market is expensive it must be a short.” In macro clearly cheap gets cheaper and expensive gets more expensive so I want to be uniquely long expensive because I think real growth expectations are rising, so tech and consumer discretionary are our two favorite sectors.
In the market, our least favorite sector currently is Energy so we're on the right side of the barbell. If Energy looks cheap, great, I think it's going to get cheaper especially levered, cheap companies with bad balance sheets. Because again we're bearish on oil prices, we’re bearish on commodity prices. We're bearish on anything that is reflation.
I think that's the most basic way to summarize it. I think that if you go beyond just the U.S. centric view and the commodity inflation bubble brought to us by Ben Bernanke, I'm not bullish on China, I'm not bullish European growth, I’m not bullish on a lot of things. You don't have to be either bullish or bearish on everything. I think that there are certain websites that you could read to get that view but that's more of an advertising model than it is an accuracy one.

2,06/28/17 11:07 AM EDT,Yellen's Hubris: Is She Repeating Bernanke's Big Mistake?,,,,"This guest commentary was written by Mike O'Rourke of JonesTrading. 
“Would I say there will never ever be another financial crisis, probably that would be going too far. But I do think that we are much safer and I hope that it will not be our lifetime and I don’t believe it will be.”–Fed Chair Janet Yellen June 27, 2017
There are just some things that should never be said, and then there are things that the head of a Central Bank should never say. Yellen’s hubristic comments are rooted in her confidence in the post-crisis reform, oversight and regulation. Her words exude the confidence of an academic Central Banker who believes markets and the economy can be micromanaged on a safe and steady path. The Fed Chair’s comment is alarming because investors and traders are well aware that we live in an uncertain world with infinite possibilities. In addition to the technical failure among Technology names, we suspect the ignorance of Yellen’s comment undermined investor confidence.
Chair Yellen’s assertion above today is eerily reminiscent of Chairman Bernanke’s assertion a decade ago:
“All that said, given the fundamental factors in place that should support the demand for housing, we believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited, and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.” Ironically, this afternoon Chair Yellen also explained the environment preceding the global financial crisis. “Most advanced economies were pretty stable, macro performance was good. Inflation which has been very high in the seventies and brought down in the eighties was pretty low and stable. Central Bankers were patting themselves on the back, that they understood how to do their jobs and that they had developed frameworks that worked. I think many people thought- the business cycle we figured all of this out, it is fundamentally dead. Perhaps that was a problem also for individuals who thought –you know what, this isn’t a very risky environment perhaps that whole environment was one that encouraged undue risk taking especially with low interest rates- people searching for yield.”
Is that not what Chair Yellen has done today, patting her own back highlighting the safety and soundness of the system? Honestly, if one did not know she was talking about 2007, you would think she was talking about 2017.
Financial stability, financial conditions and asset valuations appear to be high on the Fed’s list of concerns lately. In the past 48 hours, the three most influential Fed officials have weighed in on these topics. NY Fed President Dudley started the week noting that easy financial conditions are allowing the FOMC to continue to tighten amidst decelerating employment and inflation growth. Today, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair Stanley Fischer gave a speech on financial stability offering a more reasoned perspective:
“However, it would be foolish to think we have eliminated all risks. For example, we still have limited insight into parts of the shadow banking system, and--as already mentioned--uncertainty remains about the final configuration of short-term funding markets in the wake of money funds reform.”
A portion of Fischer's speech was devoted to asset valuations. The Vice Chair described the appetite for risk as “high” while noting that “Prices of risky assets have increased in most major asset markets in recent months even as risk-free rates also rose. In equity markets, price-to-earnings ratios now stand in the top quintiles of their historical distributions, while corporate bond spreads are near their post-crisis lows.”
Chair Yellen also weighed in on asset valuations today.
“Asset valuations are somewhat rich if you use some traditional metrics like price earnings ratios, but I wouldn’t try to comment on appropriate valuations and those ratios…asset prices can move and we don’t target asset prices. We’re focused on employment and inflation. What is very important from our point of view is the soundness of the financial system… Asset prices can move they can cause losses to individuals who decided to invest in things that fall in price, but we’re worried about systemic risk and with a strong banking system those kind of repercussions are not at the top of my list.”
It is not every day that the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve both weigh in on asset valuations describing them as “rich.” After a decade of Fed officials (including Yellen and Dudley) openly admitting that policy supported asset prices and was intended to push investors further out on the risk curve, the Chair is attempting to return to the forgotten mantra that policy is driven by developments in the economy.
This appears to be a coordinated effort when taken into consideration with President Dudley’s comments about financial conditions easing. What is most powerful here is that Yellen is redirecting the focus of the Fed Put away from asset values and placing it more narrowly on systemic risks. While we do not believe this Fed has the fortitude to truly step away from supporting asset prices, we do believe there is a great deal of risk associated with Chair Yellen’s overconfidence in the system and the environment she has created.

3,06/29/17 07:51 AM EDT,Why Mainstream Media Always Screws Up Reporting on U.S. Economy,,,,"The U.S. economy is heating up. That's the latest news from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics today which revised year-over-year first quarter GDP up to 2.1% from an original estimate of 1.9%. 
Now consider these headlines, a then and now look at the ""advance estimate"" of GDP from April and today's third revision:
Not to pick on MarketWatch, but headlines like this are pervasive across the mainstream media. Media outlets look at, what we see as, an arbitrary measure of GDP called the quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate. It's a clunky measure you'd never see on the financial statements of any publically-traded company and subject to massive revisions. The QoQ SAAR for the first quarter of 2017 was originally estimated at 0.7% revised to today's 1.4%.
Don't get whipped around by these wonky measures. Instead, we look at year-over-year growth which more accurately captures the trend in the U.S. economy. Here goes: In the first quarter of 2015, year-over-year GDP peaked at 3.3% fell to 1.3% by the second quarter of 2016 and has since rebounded to 2.1% in the first quarter of 2017.
Evidence? Recent economic data on durable goods, capital goods, corporate profits and consumer confidence  are all accelerating. Our predictive tracking algo has GDP accelerating to +2.69% and +2.99% year-over-year growth in 4Q17 and 1Q18. 
And, in this environment, you want to be long Large Caps, Growth Stocks & Tech.

4,06/29/17 02:38 PM EDT,Is U.S. GDP Headed to 3% Growth?,,,,"Investors are getting a gift today. Stock market indices were down as much as 2% today, but the U.S. economy is accelerating.
We say buy the dip.
That’s been our mantra on every stock market pullback for the past seven months now. The S&P 500 is up 7% in the last six months, and Nasdaq is up 14.4% since then.
There’s good reason for this. In the first quarter of 2015, year-over-year GDP peaked at 3.3%, fell to 1.3% by the second quarter of 2016, and has since rebounded to 2.1% in the first quarter of 2017.
“This is what economic growth has done. This is not subject to partisan politics,” says Hedgeye CEO Keith McCullough in the video above from The Macro Show this morning.
“This is the main reason you’re making money being long growth stocks is because U.S. growth accelerated,” McCullough says. We expect the U.S. economy to continue to go up from here. “And before you know it you’re going to have close to 3% GDP growth, just as the IMF takes down their forecast,” McCullough says.
“I like that.”
