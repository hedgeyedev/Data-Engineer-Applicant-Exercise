-Jordan Ellenberg
How’s your head feeling this morning? Mine’s feeling great. For this week’s holiday parties, unless you’re allergic to its implications, can the ‘gluten free’ thing. Drink lots of water and eat lots of bread!
Being bearish in a raging bull market can give you a headache. Take it from someone who’s been there and tried that. When both the research (growth and inflation accelerating) and quantitative signals are bullish, being bullish is cool.
Yeah, I know. Shorting a market because A) you weren’t long it to begin with and B) you can tell your non-market friends it’s “expensive” eventually has a breaking point. Valuation is not a bear market catalyst.
Back to the Global Macro Grind…
In an epic bull market correction, both the Nasdaq and SP500 closed down -0.1% last week.
Being Long Gold and Long-term Bonds provided a much larger headache. Gold was down another -2.1% (taking its Q4 draw-down to -13.9%) and the US 10yr Treasury Yield rose another 12 basis points (up 100bps for Q4 alone).
Long #StrongDollar though – oh, now that was a Christmas present!
Down -14.1% for Q4 to-date? Omg. And guys like me who took a week to pivot out of Gold Bond (post Trump’s win) thought they used to have a headache!
QTD returns matter, especially as we approach the end of the Q part (quarter). Whether you pivoted 4, 5, or 6 weeks ago is definitely going to matter. Most of the quarter’s returns have been made since the 2nd week of November.
The quarter-to-date (QTD) hasn’t been kind and bountiful to all:
I know. I heard. Quad2 #RatesRising isn’t great for everything that’s levered. And there’s one way to deal with that – I’m not long Real Estate! I’m long Energy via the Oil & Gas ETF (XOP) though. That’s a good way to be long #InflationAccelerating.
If you look at a lower-beta version of being long Energy Stocks (XLE), it only corrected -0.1% last week. The XLE is +8.4% for Q4 to-date and with Oil’s Volatility (OVX) crashing through 30, I think that Mr. Macro Market has that right too.
Like US stocks, Oil actually has a POSITIVE 30-day correlation to #StrongDollar too:
Unlike Consumer Staples (XLP), Energy has beta. From a US Equity Style Factor perspective, High Beta stocks gave you a rare “buying opportunity”, closing -2.3% last week. Inclusive of that correction, High Beta is still +13.2% in the last 3 months!
Compare that to the alternative (Low Beta), which is down -0.4% in the last 3 months (we map all of these style and performance factors measuring the Top Quartile of SP500 performance vs. the Bottom Quartile, fyi).
If “expensive” (High Beta) is getting more expensive and boring is getting cheaper, what’s the catalyst to change that? Maybe “year-end”? The problem with that idea is that the score at the end of the year will still count.
Our immediate-term Global Macro Risk Ranges are now:
UST 10yr Yield 2.33-2.6%
SPX 2
NASDAQ 5
XOP 40.65-43.98  USD 100.75-103.35  EUR/USD 1.03-1.06  YEN 112.90-118.93  Oil (WTI) 49.28-53.77
Gold 1125-1160
Best of luck out there today,
