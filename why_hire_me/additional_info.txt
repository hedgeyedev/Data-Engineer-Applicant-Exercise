I develop on Linux, Mac, and PC effectively.
My primary coding languages are Perl and Python, in that order.
I love Perl for it's flexibilty and ease of use. I love Python for the same reasons.
I use LiClypse for development in Python, and I write my Perl scripts in gedit on Linux, and Notepad++ on Windows.
I am one of the hardest workers and quickest learners, and I am excited to use my skills in a professional environment.
