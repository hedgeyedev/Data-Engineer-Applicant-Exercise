I use PyCharm as IDE for Python projects, some of my lastest projects are related with Computer Vision (OpenCV),
Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Keras, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and MatPlotLib)

When I code in Java I use Netbeans as IDE. Also, I use GitHub.com and BitBucket.org to save and sync my projects.

Finally, I use Internet as my most powerful tool to learn, practice and find solutions and new perspectives to problems.


There is nothing like sharing ideas and team work.
