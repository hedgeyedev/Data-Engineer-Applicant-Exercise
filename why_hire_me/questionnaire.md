**What are your opinions on Agile software development?**
Based on my experience with Agile scrum from my internship, I felt that it was well organized. I liked how tasks were delegated to their respective time-frames, and that were was frequent communication with the client to ensure that the project was following expectations, as well as having enough time to compromise necessary changes due to circumstances. It is definitely something that I would like from a working environment to minimalize stress and frustration.

**TDD or BDD?**
I lack experience using both methodologies. However, after researching both of them, I would pick BDD because it is better for looking at software as a whole rather than individual functions. This would make it easier to test if the project is accomplishing the desired goals.
