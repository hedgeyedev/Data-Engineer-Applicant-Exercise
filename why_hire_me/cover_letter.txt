About me, I started gaming on computers at a young age and I was instantly fascinated with how computer games were created from code. In college I learned the basics of a few languages vb.NET, c++, java and javascript. While in school I also started with to play around with some html and created a few sites in the early 2000's when iframes were cool, but around that time I couldn't find a job as a programmer since most companies were looking for experience. Instead I got a job in computer networking towards the end of college. After a few years in the IT sector, a job position for application developer opened up at my employer. I went for it and got the position, I started programing in vb.net and in 2013 we started migrating our legacy application to Ruby on Rails and I fell in love with Ruby and coding in general again.

Through my work experience and other personal projects I was able to teach myself ruby and python. Since I worked with data that was HIPPA compliant, I was not able to use Heroku and was required to build an on premises server that required me to learn other open source technologies like ubuntu/linux, bash scripting, nginx, passenger and postgresql/mysql.

I have been consulting since 2016 and I am now seeking to locate a challenging position in development that will allow me to refine the skills I have already learned, and which will also encourage me to explore new technologies and constantly improve my abilities and skill set.
