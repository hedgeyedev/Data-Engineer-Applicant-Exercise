Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to express interest in applying for the Data Engineer position at Hedgeye.

My journey as a Software Developer began when, as a Psychology major nearing graduation, 
I took an Intro to Computer Science course. Although intrigued by the mayhem that is the 
human mind, I was always a person of logic. And programming, to me, seemed to be the 
transformation of logic into creativity. I was won over. Thereafter, I grounded myself 
in the fundamentals of object-oriented design, data structures and algorithms through 
more advanced courses. I learned, outside of school, other languages such as Python and 
JavaScript. Of course, the learning never stops, and I am continuously seeking to enhance 
my skills in these and more.

In my past internship and current contract role, I've had the pleasure of applying such 
skills in a real-world scenarios. Every day, I've tackled the challenge of figuring out 
how to solve problems Iâ€™d never encountered before. At Viacom, I was immersed in an 
Agile environment, in which my team and I built a web application intended to help 
development teams improve their workflow. It ultimately proved to be valuable to the 
company. At NBC, I've been building proofs of concepts of software designed to steer 
business decisions. My desire is to continue building software that act as creative 
solutions, and provide value. I want to continue to hone and apply the skills I possess, 
and learn new ones each day in order to benefit my team, and grow as a Developer. 

As part of this application, I've filled out the questionnaire, and completed the exercises. 
For the refactoring exercise, I chose to use Python. I look forward to your evaluation of 
said exercises. Thank you.


Sincerely,

Farhat Nader
