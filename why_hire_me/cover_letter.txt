Dear HR manager,
When I read the job posting from CyberCoders looking for a Junior Data Engineer, I knew that it would be a great fit for me. I graduated from the University of New Haven on May 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering, and completed an internship with Prometheus Research from August 2016 to February 2017. Since then, I have been looking for my first full-time position to progress with my long-term career in Software Development and Database Administration. 

Two of the requested qualifications listed on the job posting, SQL databases and Python, are both skills that I have learned to use outside of college course work for my own side projects. I always feel satisfaction when I manage to accomplish a challenge that I set for myself, and a junior position would be the perfect setting for me to expand my experience. At my internship, I especially enjoyed learning as I worked with co-workers to receive assistance, as well as provide assistance, to overcoming obstacles.  

I may lack experience with Ruby on Rails, but I consider myself a fast learner when it comes to hands-on experience, and I would be eager to learn. When given a challenge, I feel confident that I will figure out how to accomplish it. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you consider me for the next step of the employment process. 

Sincerely,
Jeff Falberg
