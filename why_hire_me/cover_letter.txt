Dear Hiring Manager:
I may not have majored in Computer Science, but I did specialize in working with data during my time as a Computer Science minor. 
My research advisor consistently gave me and my team work of a post-graduate level. 
In my Philosophy major I honed my skills with logic, and developed strong writing and communication abilities.
I am confident that my skills and my passion for data are a perfect match for this position.

I would bring to your company a broad range of skills, including:
	Years of experience coding in Perl and Python
	A thorough understanding of the Software Development Life-Cycle
	Strong proficiency gathering and organzing data from both databases and the web
	Strong writing and critical analysis skills
	Strong interpersonal and communication skills

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss this position with you. 

Sincerely,

Will Stoddard
