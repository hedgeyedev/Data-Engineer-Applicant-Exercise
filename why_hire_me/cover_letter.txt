	I am writing to express my interest in securing the Data Engineer postion at Hedgeye. I gained strong technical knowledge by working as a software engineer at Huawei Technologies and as Data Platform Intern at Silver Spring Networks, Portland. Having worked on android mobile applications, android multimedia frameworks, Data analytics and Machine learning techniques, I have the technical expertise to understand customer needs and build applications.

	I understand that the position requires a lot of skill and determination to come out successful. I know Hedgeye will have high expectations from the candidate. I feel confident that I can fulfill the requirements for the position. I was awarded the best performer of my team at Huawei Technologies for taking up the ownership of a module in a short span of time and having customer first as a core value, which serves as a testimony for my dedication to work.

	To date, my experience was extremely rewarding and productive. It would be my pleasure to discuss the position and my qualifications with you in more details soon. I have attached my resumefor your perusal and you may reach me at (312) 918-2601, or by email at srinivasanramaraju@gmail.com. Thank you for your time and consideration.


I like macvim a lot. I don't use IDE for coding, I prefer using my vim. I like it because I can configure my shortcut keys and add the plugins i need. The nerd tree structure, split screen features are so cool.
