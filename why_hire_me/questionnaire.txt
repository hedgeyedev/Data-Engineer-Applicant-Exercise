How many years of development experience do you have?
I've consistently been working on development projects
throughout my 4 years of college. Additionally, I took 
a course called Topics In Software Development in which 
I led a team of developers in a project assigned to us
by a real-world client selected by the professor.
In this course we studied the SDLC and collaberated
with the client to produce a webapp.

How many years of other high level language(s) if not Ruby or JavaScript do you have?

Perl is my primary language and I am skilled with it.

What are your opinions on Agile software development?
I think it is effective, the Topics In Software Development
course taught us to work in a Scrum framework. Agile development
allows for rapid prototyping and adaptability. These align well
with my personal coding style and focus. Frequent collaberation
with the client is also very helpful and effective to the process,
as the client doesn't always know precisely what they want from the
start. This allows developers and clients to grow a project together,
which is often much more effective than developers giving the client
a finished product that the client then realizes wasn't what they wanted.

TDD or BDD?
The two are not mutually exclusive. Behavior Driven Development informs and enriches
one's performance of Test Driven Development. Tests are one's benchmarks, but behavior is
how one reaches those benchmarks. BDD assumes nothing about the implementation of ones code,
and as such provides the developers with a test that will inform them regarding behavior across
every implementation scenario.

Do you have any Ruby or Ruby on Rails experience?
I have 1 year of experience with Ruby, though I've never used Ruby on Rails.
However, I am a fast learner.

What are you looking for in a job?
I'm looking for something engaging and collaberative. I work very well with a team,
and dealing with data is like an endlessly engaging puzzle to me. I can code for hours
sometimes forgetting to eat. I have led teams, and I've been lead, and love working with 
others in either setting.
