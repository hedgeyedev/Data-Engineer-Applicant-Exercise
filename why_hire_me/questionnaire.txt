What are your opinions on Agile software development?
As a preface I tend towards being adaptable and open minded.  In short, having the “right” leaders/team members likely influences Agile a lot.  I think it could be a great experience/outcome with the right team but given the same project/team using a different approach might not have as great of an outcome.  As a coder, it sounds like Agile can result in an amazing balance of freedom, challenges and fun.

TDD or BDD?

What are you looking for in a job?
I am looking for a job where I can allocate more of my time to contributing to/working with a team (both independently within the team and collectively) , mastering a stack, and building something useful!  Much of my last 6 months of coding has centered on rapidly training up on a technology, building simple apps with it, and moving on to another technology.  I’ve learned a lot in this process but am ready to be part of, learn from, and contribute to a team!
