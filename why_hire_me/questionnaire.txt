What are your opinions on Agile software development?
-- I think that it's a very productive way of creating software. I'm a big fan of daily standups, sprint meetings, etc. It's important for everyone to know where everyone else is with the project. The idea of an MVP is crucial, as having working software at each interval allows the team to determine which direction is best to take next, or how to evolve both the product and the team's practices.

TDD or BDD?
-- I haven't formally worked with either. I had exposure to TDD in a past internship, and the impression I got was that TDD helps the developer guide himself/herself to clean, simple code. It's a good way to keep yourself in check, and keep from 'coloring outside the lines', in a sense.
